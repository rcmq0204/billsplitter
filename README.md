# billsplitter_app

This app was created to solve a problem me and my friends commonly face when splitting meal bills, especially when everyone consumed different things of different prices.

The ipynb file was what was first used, but it meant I had to be at a laptop to use it. Hence, I created the webapp using streamlit in order to be able to do the splitting without my laptop. Click [link](https://billsplitter.streamlit.app/) to try :).

This was the first web app I created using streamlit during my undergrad days just for fun. :)
