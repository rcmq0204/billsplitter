# billsplitter_app

This app was created to solve a problem me and my friends commonly face when splitting meal bills, especially when everyone consumed different things of different prices.

The ipynb file was what was first used, but it meant I had to be at a laptop to use it. Hence, I created the webapp using streamlit in order to be able to do the splitting without my laptop.

This was what I could do so far on my own, but I still feel there are more ways to improve it but I'm proud of what I achieved here and will hopefully improve it in the future
